Group analysis with NeuroPycon
==============================

The code contains the [NeuroPycon pipelines](https://github.com/neuropycon) to analyze
an open dataset ([Wakeman and Henson (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20151)).

The data consist of simultaneous MEG/EEG recordings from 19 healthy participants performing a visual recognition task. 
Subjects were presented images of famous, unfamiliar and scrambled faces. Each subject participated in 6 runs, each 7.5 min in duration. 
The data were acquired with an Elekta Neuromag Vectorview 306 system. In addition, a 70 channel Easycap EEG system was used for recording EEG data simultaneously. 

We provide the scripts to fetch the data, preprocess the MEG raw data and perform source reconstruction of time locked event-related field.
